# Battle
```
As two Players,
So we can play a personalised game of Battle,
We want to Start a fight by entering our names and seeing them

As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to winning
I want to see Player 2's Hit Points

As Player 1,
So I can win a game of Battle,
I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation

As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP

As two Players,
So we can continue our game of Battle,
We want to switch turns
